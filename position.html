  <div class="wrapper">

    <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">1. Point Guard</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The Point Guard is usually the shortest but the best ball handler on the team. Also known as the ‘coach on the floor’ or the ‘floor general’, a point guard is responsible for directing plays.

He needs to have good court vision to create open shots for the receivers as well as drive the ball down the court and initiate offensive plays.

Point Guards need to have an excellent long-distance shooting, though it’s not quite as crucial as for shooting guards, some point guards take as many shots as shooting guards.  </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">2.Shooting Guard</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Potentially the shortest player on the team, the Shooting Guard is the team’s best outside shooter. Besides being able to shoot well, the Shooting Guard needs to be good at dribbling fast, passing and having court vision by seeing the court.

He is also responsible for driving the ball down the court and setting up offensive plays.

A good Shooting Guard will be a threat to his opponent as he’s able to score from anywhere on the court.  </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">3. Small Forward</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The Small Forward is usually the shorter of the two forwards on the team but plays the most versatile role out of the main five positions.

He must have enough height and the ability to play on the inside as well as agility to play on the outside, similar to a shooting guard. Small Forwards are usually the second or third best shooters on the team and should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court.  </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">4. Power Forward</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Power Forwards are usually the second tallest in the team and are the closest to the centre in terms of physical attributes and playing style but with more speed.

They are often the most versatile player, being able to score in the paint as well as being able to shoot from midrange. It will be more effective if they’re able to land a three-point consistently.

Defensively, they are required to have the strength to guard bigger players close to the basket  </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">5. Centre</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The centre is usually the team’s tallest and strongest player and is positioned under the basket. He is also required to be physically domineering with more physical strength and athleticism.

On the offensive play, most centres do not consistently score midrange or beyond the arch. Instead, most of their points should be from offensive rebounds and are also required to block defenders to open other players up for driving to the basket.

On the defence, the centre is responsible for keeping the opponent from shooting by blocking shots and passes in the vital area. They’re also expected to fight for rebounds as they’re usually taller physically.  </p>
