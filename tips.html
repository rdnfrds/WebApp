    <h2>How to Develop into a Great Shooter</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">

      <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">STEP 1: DEVELOPING THE SHOOTING RELEASSE</button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p></p>
        Most of you have seen this 1-hand shooting form drill. Even though
        it is nothing new, don't dismiss the importance of this
        foundational drill. This reinforces good technique of the
        "release" portion of your shot.
        <p></p>
        For this progression, we focus on getting our feet about
        shoulder width apart or slightly narrower.
        <p></p>
        You should be in a strong, balanced position.
        <p></p>
        Make sure to check your feet and develop consistency on
        every shot. We prefer to slightly stagger our feet or
        slightly turn them. The anatomy is different for every one. You need to find what works for you.
        <p></p>
        Next, make an L with your shooting arm.
        <p></p>
        Focus on pushing the ball up and out. Your elbow should finish
        above your eyes.
        <p></p>
        Focus on pushing the ball through your fingers. Typically, you
        should either finish with your index finger pointing at the hoop
        or with your index/middle finger pointing at the hoop. Find what
        works best for you.
        <p></p>
        When you properly shoot "up and out" and "push through your fingers",
        you will get the proper backspin on the ball.
        <p></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">STEP 2: ADDING THE GUIDE HAND TOO THE SHOOTING RELEASE</button>
      <div class="panel">

<p></p>
Next, we work on adding the guide hand to the shooting release.
<p></p>
Since athletes have a tendency to use their guide hand, we do
not have guide hand touch the ball in this progression.
<p></p>
This is highly important because when you overuse the guide hand,
a lot of players will miss to the right and the left. If you can
eliminate shooting to the right or left, you will automatically
make more shots.
<p></p>
<p></p>
Emphasis Points
<p></p>
Guide hand near the side of the ball. Do not place guide hand in front or behind basketball.
Fingers on guide hand pointing upwards.
</div>

<button class="accordion" type="button" style="text-align:center">STEP 3:SET TO GO</button>
<div class="panel">
<p></p>
Keep guide hand still.
<p></p>
Do not touch the ball with the guide hand.
<p></p>
The shooter starts a few feet from the basket.
<p></p>
<p></p>
In the set position, the playerâ€™s arm angle is approximately 90 degrees
and the ball is positioned near the shoulder.
<p></p>
Once the shooter is ready, the player extends their legs and shoots
at the same time in one fluid motion. The shot is like a free throw
as there is little to no jump with this progression.
<p></p>
We will shoot 5 to 10 shots, then take a step back. We usually do this
until we reach a step in front of the free throw line.
<p></p>
Also, make sure to take your time and do it right on every repetition.
If you build a bad habit by being sloppy, it will take you ten times
as long to fix the bad habit. So be smart and get in the right
position prior for every shot.
<p></p>
<p></p>
Emphasis Points
<p></p>
Start from shoulder on each shot.
<p></p>
Extend legs and shoot at the same time.
<p></p>
Keep ball close to shoulder.
<p></p>
One fluid motion - no pauses or hitches.
